Retrieve ruby core source files.

This is initially to ease running the Ruby 1.9 ruby-debug installation.

Usage:

  header_dir = Ruby_core_source::get_ruby_core_source

This will pull the Ruby sources from ftp.ruby-lang.org based on the current RUBY_VERSION, 
RUBY_PATCHLEVEL, and RUBY_REVISION, and return the directory where the *.h and *.inc files
were placed.

Note that for Ruby preview releases, the corresponding RUBY_REVISION needs to be maintained in
http://cloud.github.com/downloads/mark-moseley/ruby_core_source/preview_revision.yml

Example use in extconf.rb:

with_cppflags("-I" + Ruby_core_source::get_ruby_core_source) {
  if have_header("vm_core.h") then
    create_makefile("foo")
  else
    exit(1)
  end
}
